# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 12/02/2026
**App Name:** Spend Wise – Simple Money Tracker

---

## 1. Introduction

Spend Wise (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the Spend Wise mobile application.

Spend Wise is designed as a personal finance tracker focused on local data storage and minimal data collection.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Personal Information

Spend Wise does **not require account registration** to use core features.

We do not collect:

* Name
* Email address (unless you contact us)
* Phone number
* Government ID
* Bank credentials

---

### 2.2 Financial Data

All financial data entered into the app (including wallets, income, expenses, categories, notes, and balances):

* Is stored **locally on your device**
* Is saved using **SQLite (sqflite package)**
* Is not transmitted to our servers by default

You have full control over your financial data stored within the app.

---

### 2.3 Optional Features That May Access Data

Depending on how you use the app, the following may apply:

#### a) Cloud Services (Supabase)

If cloud sync or backup features are enabled in future versions:

* Data may be stored securely using Supabase services
* Data transmission will be encrypted (HTTPS)
* Authentication may be required

If you do not enable such features, no cloud sync occurs.

---

#### b) QR Code & Scanner

The app uses:

* `qr_flutter`
* `mobile_scanner`

These are used only when you manually scan or generate QR codes (e.g., sharing wallet data).
Camera access is used strictly for scanning QR codes and not for background recording.

---

#### c) Internet Connectivity

The app uses `connectivity_plus` to detect network availability.
No browsing history or network content is collected.

---

#### d) Data Sharing (Manual Only)

Using `share_plus`, you may export data (e.g., CSV files).
Data is shared only when you explicitly choose to share it.

---

## 3. Local Storage

Spend Wise uses:

* SQLite (sqflite) for structured financial data
* SharedPreferences for lightweight settings (e.g., theme mode, currency preference)

All data remains on your device unless you explicitly export or sync it.

---

## 4. Data Security

We implement:

* Local encrypted device storage (device-level security)
* Secure HTTPS communication (if cloud features are used)
* No third-party advertising SDKs

However, no system can guarantee absolute security. Users are responsible for protecting access to their device.

---

## 5. Data Retention

Your data remains stored on your device until:

* You delete specific entries
* You uninstall the app
* You manually clear app data

Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data unless backed up externally.

---

## 6. Children's Privacy

Spend Wise is not directed toward children under 13.
We do not knowingly collect data from children.

---

## 7. Third-Party Services

The app may use:

* Supabase (if cloud features enabled)
* Device OS services (iOS / Android)
* QR & sharing libraries

These services may have their own privacy policies.

---

## 8. Your Rights

You have full control over your data:

* Add / edit / delete wallets
* Add / edit / delete transactions
* Export data
* Delete all data by uninstalling the app

No hidden data collection occurs.

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy as the app evolves.
Changes will be reflected with an updated "Effective Date".
